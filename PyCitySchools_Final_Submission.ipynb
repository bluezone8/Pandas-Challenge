    "The results of the analysis of PyCity Schools reveal some very dramatic and valuable results for the school system.  The performance of schools in terms of math and reading test scores across the the population of students varies greatly within the system.   Related to this, a number of interesting observations are worth noting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The top performing schools significant exceed the average for all schools in test scores.  This difference is most pronounced in the numbers of students passing math, reading, and both.  The Top performing schools have almost 20% more of the student population passing math than the average, greater than 10% more passing reading, and greater than 25% passing both subjects.  Furthermore the top schools exceed the bottom performing schools with almost 30% greater percentage of the total number of students passing math, and a very striking difference of almost 40% of the percentage of the student populations of each school passing both subjects\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The budget/ spend for a school is not in and of iteslf a root cause statistic.  However, analysis of spend for the schools vs student test scores reveals some interesting results.  The schools were divided into 4 groups of budget size (240k to 980k, 980k to 1.72m, 1.72m to 2.46m, and 2.46m to 3.2m).  The data indicates a very clear and pronounced demarcation that occurs between those schools below 1.72m in budget and those above.  The schools below 1.72m in budget have average math and reading scores that are ~84 in both subjects.  Whereas, schools with spend above 1.72m have average math and reading scores of ~77 and 81 respectively.  The difference is very pronounced in the percentages of total students in the schools passing these subjects.  For those schools with spend below 1.72m the percentage of students passing is ~94% for math, ~97% for reading, and ~90% for both.  However, for schools with spend below 1.72m the percentages of students passing are ~67% for math, 81% for reading, and just over half of their total student populations passing both at ~54%.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Subject test performance differences are also seen in evaluations of scores by size of the school based on categories of number of students attending.  It must be noted that spend and size of school are directly correlated statistics and so the results are inherently related.  Schools were divided into three categories small(less than 1947 students), medium(1947 to 3468 students), and large(greater than 3468 students).  Once again, there is a clear difference in performance that occurs between small schools and schools or medium to large size. The percentage of students passing subjects in small schools is ~94% passing math, ~97% passing reading, and ~91% passing both.  For medium schools the numbers are much lower at ~72%, 84%, and 61% respectively.  For large schools the numbers continue the downward trend with size though a greatly decreased rate.  Their scores are ~67% passing math, ~81% passing reading, and ~54% passing both subjects.  These numbers, of course, reflect the same numbers seen in the budget analysis as budget and number of students are directly related.  One interesting point to note is that it is likely that the budget category for the sizes of schools, if not known, could likley be estimated due to this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Subjectively, the most interesting of the school performance analyses would be evaluations by type of school.  The results of this analysis, clearly, indicate that charter schools yield much higher results in terms of student performance than do their district counterparts.  The charter schools have an average of ~94% of the student populkation passing math, ~97% passing reading, and ~91% passing both. Whereas, the district schools have numbers of ~67%, ~81%, and ~54%.  These numbers directly reflect the numbers seen in ythe size and budget spend analyses which would tend to indicate that charter schools are smaller in size and budget than their district counterparts.  An additional analysis not included in the study that would be valauble for further enlightenment in this area would be an analysis of spend per student in charter vs district schools."
