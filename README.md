# Pandas Challenge
---
### PURPOSE

The purpose of this repository is to store analyses for x game company examining demographic and financial data for the game Heroes of Pymoli.  
#

### ANALYTICAL TOOL CHOICE RATIONALE

Two primary tools were chosen for this analysis:
1. Pandas library for Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
They were chosen for the following reasons:
1.  Pandas provides broad and powerful tools for analyzing and manipulating tabular data such as these.  Alternatives would have included Excel and direct coding in Python.  Both of these options would have proven much more difficult and time consuming to achieve the results achieved in Pandas.
2.  Jupyter Notebook offers unique functionality to facilitate analysis of data using Python libraries.
    (a) Provides the ability to code and test discrete portions of code easily within a total program
    (b)  Contains all code and analytical outputs in one file for convenience of communication.

### APPROACH
In most situations in which software code is being used to analyze data, there are multiple ways to achieve the same ends (i.e. reach the same desired, accurate anlysis).  In this situation, the particular data and instructions related to output requirements for the indvidual analyses  have enough similarity that one general scheme could be used for the whole analysis.  This not to imply that there would just be a cut and paste situation with the code, but that a similar approach could be used for set up, analysis, and output if desired.  I decided to challenge myself to split the analysis into 2 halves and come up with 2 different ways of approaching and coding  each half.  The final output contains the selected approach for each half. 

The selected approach for each half involves filtered subsets of data but the approaches to the filtering differ.  Additionally, the output for first half involves some indexing of lists. Whereas, the ouput for the second half involves creation of dictionaries and transformation to new dataframes.

### INCLUDED ITEMS
The only included items are the Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis and an HTML version of this notebook to facilitate viewing the contents of the notebook without opening the notebook in Jupyter Notebooks. (Note: This has the additional advantage of being able to see the code in color to better read and distiguish comments and code as well as see better formatted tables)
