# Pandas Challenge
---
### PURPOSE

The purpose of this repository is to store analyses for the PyCity Schools District analysis of student math and reading test perfmance for the schools in the district
#

### ANALYTICAL TOOL CHOICE RATIONALE

Two primary tools were chosen for this analysis:
1. Pandas library for Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
They were chosen for the following reasons:
1.  Pandas provides broad and powerful tools for analyzing and manipulating tabular data such as these.  Alternatives would have included Excel and direct coding in Python.  Both of these options would have proven much more difficult and time consuming to achieve the results achieved in Pandas.
2.  Jupyter Notebook offers unique functionality to facilitate analysis of data using Python libraries.
    (a) Provides the ability to code and test discrete portions of code easily within a total program
    (b)  Contains all code and analytical outputs in one file for convenience of communication. 
#

### DISCUSSION
The analysis notebook contains a sSummary Observations section that details the important obervations derived from this analysis.     
#

### INCLUDED ITEMS
The only included items are the Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis and an HTML version of this notebook to facilitate viewing the contents of the notebook without opening the notebook in Jupyter Notebooks. (Note: This has the additional advantage of being able to see the code in color to better read and distiguish comments and code as well as see better formatted tables)
