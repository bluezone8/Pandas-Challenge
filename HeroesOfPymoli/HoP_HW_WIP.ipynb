    "### There are a few noteworthy points that can be derived from this analysis that could direct opportunities for improvement for the game company\n",
    "\n",
    "###   1. Players that purchased a game items, on average, only purchased one item (1.3).  Increasing the appeal of the game items, their value proposition, and the marketing messaging to players are potential opportunities\n",
    "###   2. Purchases by gender category align exactly with the number of total players by those categories indicating that the appeal of the items is gender agnostic\n",
    "###   3. Almost half of the total purchases (47%) are made by players between the ages of 20-24 years old.  Futhermore, over 3/4ths (77%) of the total purchases are made by players between the ages of 15-29 years old.    \n",
    "###   4. The popularity of purchased items is mostly evenly distributed. Although the two most popular items  are statistically skewed in popularaity of purchases with 44% and 33% higher number of purchases than the number 3 most popular item, because of the small number of purchases of each item they only represnt 3.2% of total purchases. This seems to indicate that there are not items that are out of line in terms of their value in the game which can valuable for player satisfaction with the game and items for sale in general "
